## What You Need
 
To create your own Zone H clone script, you will need the following:
 
- A web hosting service that supports PHP and MySQL.
- A domain name of your choice.
- A web scraper tool that can collect defaced websites from Zone H or other sources.
- A PHP script that can store and display the defaced websites on your website.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Web Hosting and Domain Name
 
The first step is to set up your web hosting service and domain name. You can choose any web hosting service that supports PHP and MySQL, such as Bluehost, HostGator, or GoDaddy. You can also use a free web hosting service, such as 000webhost or InfinityFree, but be aware that they may have some limitations and restrictions. You can register your domain name with any domain registrar, such as Namecheap, GoDaddy, or Google Domains. Make sure that your domain name is related to your niche and keyword, such as zonehclone.com, defacearchive.com, or hackermirror.com.
 
Once you have your web hosting service and domain name ready, you need to connect them together. You can do this by changing the nameservers of your domain name to point to your web hosting service. This may take some time to propagate, so be patient. You can check if your domain name is working by typing it in your browser. If you see a default page from your web hosting service, then you are good to go.
 
## Step 2: Set Up Your Web Scraper Tool
 
The next step is to set up your web scraper tool that can collect defaced websites from Zone H or other sources. There are many web scraper tools available online, such as Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, or Selenium. You can also use some online services, such as ParseHub, Octoparse, or Web Scraper. For this tutorial, we will use a simple Python script that uses BeautifulSoup to scrape Zone H for defaced websites. You can download the script from [here](https://github.com/L1nu-X/Zone-H-Archive-Grabber).[^1^]
 
The script works by taking a notifier name as an input and then scraping Zone H for all the defaced websites submitted by that notifier. It then saves the URLs of the defaced websites in a text file. You can run the script on your local machine or on a cloud server, such as Google Colab or AWS EC2. To run the script, you need to install Python and BeautifulSoup on your machine or server. You also need to edit the script and paste your cookies from Zone H in order to work. You can get your cookies by logging in to Zone H and then inspecting the page source using F12 on your keyboard. You should see something like this:

Copy the values of ZHE and PHPSESSID and paste them in the script where it says "cookies". Then save the script and run it using the command:
  ```python python3 grabber.py ```  
The script will ask you for a notifier name. You can enter any notifier name that you want to scrape from Zone H, such as CyberTeamRox or Mr.XaaD. The script will then start scraping Zone H for all the defaced websites submitted by that notifier and save them in a text file named "grabbed.txt". You can check the file to see the URLs of the defaced websites.
